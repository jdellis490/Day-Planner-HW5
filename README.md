# Day-Planner-HW5

## Description

I built this project to further understand and test my knowledge of JQuery syntax. I learned that JQuery makes Javascript a little easier in a sense that it's syntax and code is less wordy and more direct. This project solves the problem of modifiying code and blending CSS and HTML elements withing JQuery. I was stumped on a few objectives for this project but I will need to review and ask questions to understand what I missed. This will allow me to further understand JQuery for future projects.
